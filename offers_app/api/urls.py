URL configuration for the offers application.

This module defines all API endpoints related to offers, offer details,
and business user offers. It uses Django REST Framework's router
for automatic ViewSet registration and explicit path definitions
for class-based views.

Routes:
    /offers/ (list, create)
    /offers/<pk>/ (retrieve, update, delete)
    /<business_user_id>/ (list offers of a specific business user)
    /offerdetails/ (list, create offer details)
    /offerdetails/<pk>/ (retrieve, update, delete single offer detail)
